Simple blogs with simple themes and words are better.

Simple blogs are easy to read. They allow readers to focus on the content.

Simple themes are more visually appealing and professional looking.

Simple words used in a simple blog are more powerful and impactful. Be direct and to the point. Just get across the message or idea.

This is what I want. A simple blog with a simple theme and simple words.
